## Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Probes combination (SGWBProbe)

This Python 3 package, accompanying the paper Campeti, Komatsu, Poletti & Baccigalupi 2020 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04241), allows to compute the binned sensitivity curves and error bars on the fractional
energy density of gravitational waves in the Universe at the present time, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Omega_{GW} h^2">, as a function of frequency for a wide selection of experiments, including CMB B-mode experiments, laser and atomic interferometers and Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA).  

The list of available experiments currently includes:
- LiteBIRD 
- Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)
- Einstein Telescope (ET)
- Square Kilometer Array (SKA)
- Big Bang Observer (BBO)
- Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO)
- <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\mu">Ares
- Decihertz Observatory (DO),
- Atomic Experiment for Dark Matter and Gravity Exploration in Space (AEDGE)

The forecasts are presented for two representative classes of models for the stochastic background of primordial GW:
- the quantum vacuum fluctuation in the metric from single-field slow-roll inflation 
- the source-induced tensor perturbation from the spectator axion-SU(2) inflation models.

where the name of each script indicates the respective number of the figures in the paper.
The figures produced by these scripts are collected in the folder `figures/`


### Available sensitivity curves and response functions
The strain sensitivity curves as a function of frequency for the experiments used in the paper are included in the `files/` folder in `.npz` format.
Their content can be easily unpacked through a simple script, e.g for the LISA experiment 
```python
LISA = np.load(op.join(op.dirname(__file__),'files/S_h_LISA_xcosmo.npz'))
LISA_freq = LISA['x']
LISA_strain = LISA['y']

```
and used in your own Python code.

The folder `files/Responses/` contains the response function as a function of frequency in `.npy` format for the laser interferometers computed as described in Appendix A of the paper. Their content can be easily unpacked through a simple script, e.g for the LISA experiment
```python
Resp_LISA = np.load(op.join(op.dirname(__file__),'files/Responses/Resp_LISA.npy'))
freq_LISA = np.load(op.join(op.dirname(__file__),'files/Responses/f_R_LISA.npy'))

```
and used in your own Python code.


The error bars for CMB experiments are computed using a Fisher matrix approach. The Fisher matrices (computed as described in Section 3 of the paper) are gathered in the folder `files/LiteBIRD_Fisher_matrices/`. 
The name of each file contains the binning width and the specific power spectrum model used to compute them (e.g. the file `Fisher_1.3_r0.npy` contains the Fisher matrix for a binning width <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta\ln k = 1.3"> for the single-field slow-roll model with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\r=0">).
