## Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Probe Combination (SGWBProbeComb)

This package allows to compute the binned sensitivity curves and error bars on the fractional
energy density of gravitational waves in the Universe at the present time, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Omega_{GW} h^2">, as a function of frequency for two representative classes
of models for the stochastic background of primordial GW: the quantum vacuum fluctuation
in the metric from single-field slow-roll inflation, and the source-induced tensor perturbation
from the spectator axion-SU(2) inflation models.


We provide python scripts that can be used to reproduce each the figures found in the paper Campeti, Komatsu, Poletti & Baccigalupi 2020 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04241), that is 
 [Fig_1.py](https://github.com/pcampeti/SGWBProbe/blob/main/Fig_1.py), `Fig_2.py`, `Fig_3.py`, `Fig_4-7.py`, `Fig_8.py`, `Fig_9-13.py`, `Fig_14-16.py`, `Fig_17.py`, `Fig_18-20.py`, `Fig_21.py`, `Fig_23.py`.
Note that the name of each script contains the respective number of the figure in the paper which can reproduce.
